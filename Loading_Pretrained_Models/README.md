This Folder will consists on how to load pretrained model to your intel edge device and its FAQ section will clear some of your doubts. It will also consists code of how to load some pretrained models which I worked on.

## Why to use Pretrained Models?

* Higher Accuracy 

* Directly integrated to Inference Engine

## Types of Computer Vision Models

* **Classification**: Determines Class. 

* **Detection**: Object and their Location.

* **Segmentation**:  Classifies Each and Every pixel

  * **Semantic Segmentation**: All objects of same class are one

  * **Instance Segmentation**: Each object of a class is separate.
  
**Note**: There are other models as well which include Pose estimation, OCR and GANS, they dont fall under these categories. 

## Different Types of Architecture used?
